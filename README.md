# mansplain
> a cli app to mansplain man pages to you

It uses AI (run locally by ollama) to summarise a manual page in a condescending way, in case you like that sorta thing.

## Useage
You can just run it (it uses llama2 by default)
```bash
mansplain yes
```

Or specify a model
```bash
mansplain -model=mistral xz
```
